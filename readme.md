3\. Implement OTP-based authentication during material handover

4\. Provide automated notifications to involved users

5\. Ensure accountability and traceability at each stage

6\. Facilitate Excel-based report generation

7\. Design scalable architecture for use across all plants



**The tech stack that can be used for the project is the following:**



1\. Frontend: React.js + Tailwind CSS

2\. Backend: Node.js 

3\. Database: PostgreSQL (transactional)

4\. Notifications: OTP

5\. Auth: JWT-based session with OTP verification

6\. Reporting: Node-based CSV/Excel generator
