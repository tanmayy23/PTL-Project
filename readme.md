3\. Implement OTP-based authentication during material handover

4\. Provide automated notifications to involved users

5\. Ensure accountability and traceability at each stage

6\. Facilitate Excel-based report generation

7\. Design scalable architecture for use across all plants

8\. Designing the dashboards for better understanding of the product status and handler availability. 



**The tech stack that can be used for the project is the following:**



1\. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

2\. Backend: Node.js (Express.js) 

3\. Database: PostgreSQL (transactional)

4\. Notifications: OTP (Within the portal)

5\. Reporting: Node-based CSV/Excel generator
